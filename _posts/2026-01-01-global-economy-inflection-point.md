title: The Global Economy at an Inflection Point

  The global economy in 2025 is not collapsing, but it is decisively
  re-wiring itself. Slowing growth, extreme trade policy uncertainty,
  and geopolitically driven fragmentation are pushing the world away
  from hyper-globalization toward a just-in-case model that prioritizes
  security and resilience over pure efficiency.

The global economy in 2025 stands at a precarious **inflection point**.

Growth has slowed to **2.6 per cent**, trade policy uncertainty has surged to levels **ten times higher** than the previous decade, and yet the system has not collapsed. Instead, what is unfolding is something more subtle and more structural: a **reshaping of global trade itself**.

The era of frictionless hyper-globalization is ending. In its place, a world of redundancy, regionalization, and strategic buffers is emerging.

## The Illusion of Resilience

At first glance, global trade in early 2025 appeared surprisingly resilient.

World merchandise trade expanded by roughly **4 per cent in real terms** during the first half of the year, defying widespread pessimism. But this strength was deceptive.

A significant share of the growth was driven by **frontloading**—firms and consumers in North America accelerated purchases ahead of expected tariff hikes. Once these one-off effects and AI-related capital investments are stripped out, underlying trade growth falls to a far more modest **2.5–3.0 per cent**.

As tariff measures begin to bite and frontloading fades, trade momentum is expected to **slow sharply into 2026**. What looked like resilience was, in reality, a temporary pull-forward of demand.


## From Hyper-Globalization to “Just-in-Case”

The deeper shift underway is not cyclical—it is structural.

Global supply chains are being redesigned around **geopolitical risk**, not just cost efficiency. Firms are prioritizing resilience, redundancy, and national security over the razor-thin margins that defined the early 2000s.

This transition marks a move toward a **“just-in-case” trade model**, where excess capacity and regional diversification are no longer inefficiencies but strategic assets.


## ASEAN: The New Supply-Chain Anchor

While much of the world struggles with stagnation, **ASEAN has emerged as the standout beneficiary** of this reconfiguration.

For the fourth consecutive year, ASEAN remains the **largest FDI destination among developing regions**. In 2024 alone, inflows rose **8 per cent to a record $226 billion**, even as global FDI declined by 11 per cent.

Three forces underpin this shift:

### Semiconductors  
ASEAN now accounts for **over 20 per cent of global semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging**, attracting approximately **$12 billion in annual investment**.

### Electric Vehicles  
Chinese firms are rapidly expanding EV and battery supply chains across the region. **Chinese FDI into ASEAN has grown at an average annual rate of 33 per cent since 2020**, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Viet Nam emerging as key nodes.

### Digital Infrastructure  
Greenfield investment in digital infrastructure **more than doubled to $16 billion in 2024**, supported by a network of **over 390 data centres** across the region.

ASEAN is no longer peripheral to global trade—it is becoming one of its central organizing hubs.


## The Great Reallocation Between Superpowers

Despite frequent headlines about decoupling, the data tells a more nuanced story.

The U.S.-China relationship is undergoing a **“great reallocation”**, not a clean break.

- Direct U.S.-China trade fell from **3.5 per cent of global goods trade in 2016 to 2.6 per cent in 2024**
- China’s share of U.S. goods imports dropped from **22 per cent in 2017 to 14 per cent in 2023**

Yet Chinese production has not vanished—it has **rerouted**.

So-called **connector states** such as **Mexico, Viet Nam, and the United Arab Emirates** have absorbed rising trade volumes, often acting as intermediaries through which Chinese value-added reaches Western markets indirectly.

Mexico’s rise is emblematic: it has now surpassed China as the **largest source of U.S. imports**, accounting for **15.7 per cent** of total trade.


## The Hidden Material Cost of the Digital Economy

The digital economy is often perceived as intangible. In reality, it is profoundly material-intensive.

- A **2 kg computer** requires nearly **800 kg of raw materials**
- A **smartphone** consumes roughly **70 kg of materials** over its lifecycle

The demand for critical minerals—**lithium, cobalt, and graphite**—is projected to increase by **500 per cent by 2050** as green and digital technologies scale.

The energy and water implications are equally stark:

- Global **data centres consumed ~460 TWh of electricity in 2022**, comparable to France’s total usage
- Consumption is projected to reach **1,000 TWh by 2026**
- Training a single large AI model can require **700,000 litres of potable water** for cooling

The digital transition is not dematerializing the economy—it is **re-materializing it in new ways**.


## The Dollar: Dominant but Gradually Eroding

Despite growing experimentation with alternative settlement systems, the **U.S. dollar remains the global financial anchor**.

It still accounts for **89 per cent of global foreign-exchange transactions**. However, its dominance as a reserve currency has been slowly declining since 2000.

By the end of 2024:
- **Monetary gold surpassed the euro** as the second-largest reserve asset
- Gold’s share crossed the **20 per cent threshold**

Diversification is happening—not abruptly, but persistently.


## The Case for Re-Globalization

The risks of unchecked fragmentation are severe. Estimates suggest that deep trade fragmentation could reduce global GDP by up to **7 per cent**.

To counter this, institutions such as the WTO and UNCTAD advocate a strategy of **“re-globalization”**—not a return to hyper-globalization, but a broader and more inclusive integration of economies and issues.

Key challenges remain:
- A **$4 trillion annual financing gap** for the Sustainable Development Goals
- Investment in critical sectors such as renewable energy and water fell by **over 60 per cent in developing countries in 2024**

True resilience will not emerge from unilateral protectionism, but from **networked multilateralism**, coordinated investment, and the development of a **circular digital economy**.


## Conclusion

The global economy in 2025 is not breaking—it is **bending into a new shape**.

Growth is slower, trade is more fragmented, and uncertainty is structurally higher. Yet capital, technology, and production are not retreating; they are **reorganizing**.

Understanding this transition—separating temporary noise from enduring structural shifts—is the defining analytical challenge of the decade ahead.
