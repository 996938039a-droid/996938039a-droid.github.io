### Cognitive Hegemony: The Reordering of Global Power in the Era of Compute

The foundational structure of global power is currently undergoing a phase transition as dramatic as the 19th-century shift from agrarian to industrial societies. [1]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty This transformation is characterized by a move away from territorial and military supremacy toward a paradigm defined by information processing asymmetry, entropy reduction capacity, and control over the physical and digital architectures of reasoning (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400458611_Entropy_Prediction_and_Open_Futures_Why_Intelligence_Experiences_Possibility_in_a_Determined_World) [2]. In this 21st-century landscape, dominance is no longer a simple function of geographic size or kinetic force, but rather the ability of a state or corporate actor to maintain a predictive modeling advantage over its competitors (https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/22/2205) [3]. This shift manifests in the concentration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) compute, the control of submarine data arteries, the monopolization of advanced semiconductor fabrication, and the engineering of algorithmic narrative environments (https://humane-intelligence.org/post/changing-geopolitics-from-data-center-concentration/) [4]. Collectively, these factors constitute a new form of geopolitical leverage: **Cognitive Sovereignty** (https://jurnal.untirta.ac.id/index.php/aiselt/article/download/37160/15980) [5]. 21st-century geopolitical dominance is increasingly determined by control over this cognitive infrastructure — data, compute, digital networks, and narrative platforms — rather than physical territory alone (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1]. Consequently, state sovereignty in the modern age must now include **epistemic independence**, or the ability of a society to interpret its own reality without structural reliance on foreign informational filters (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1].

### I. Historical Architecture of Power

Geopolitical dominance has historically evolved through a series of structural epochs, each defined by a primary strategic asset and the infrastructure required to harness it (https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/04/visualizing-the-history-of-energy-transitions/) [6]. The **agrarian era** was characterized by the control of arable land and caloric output, while the **industrial era** centered on mechanical production and the transportation of high-tonnage goods via rail and sea (https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9318/w9318.pdf) [7]. The **energy era** of the 20th century focused on the control of hydrocarbons and the secure movement of molecules, leading to the rise of financialized information systems that prioritized the transmission of bits (http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/2856/1/71.pdf.pdf) [8].

The current transition into the era of **AI and compute** represents a qualitative phase change because it focuses on the *processing* and *interpretation* of data rather than its mere transmission (https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/dd7c2387-2f60-4b60-8c5f-6563b6aa1e4c/EnergyandAI.pdf) [9]. This transition is fundamentally thermodynamic: previous power models were built around the combustion of molecules (petroleum, coal), a process that surrenders most of its energy to entropy (https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/reframing-energy-for-the-age-of-electricity/) [10]. For example, in 2023, molecules achieved only a 29% efficiency in delivering useful work, whereas electron-based systems reached 68% (https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/reframing-energy-for-the-age-of-electricity/) [10]. As the world enters the "Age of Electricity," power accrues to those who can master the "electron economy" to power massive AI infrastructures (https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/reframing-energy-for-the-age-of-electricity/) [10].

A direct parallel exists between 20th-century oil chokepoints and 21st-century semiconductor chokepoints. Just as control over the Strait of Hormuz allowed states to regulate the flow of the global economy's "master resource," control over top-tier Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and the lithography machines required to build them now determines which nations can participate in the frontier of human intelligence (https://iamvishalkhare.medium.com/gpu-diplomacy-how-export-controls-on-gpus-are-rewriting-global-alliances-e598c30208fc) [11]. This shift is further modeled by the decline of net energy; as the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) for petroleum is projected to fall below unity by 2081 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15252) [12], the petroleum-centric power model will cease to be viable. In its place, the "Intelligence Economy" utilizes AI to optimize the production and transport of energy, making the ability to reduce "societal entropy"—the disorder inherent in complex systems—the ultimate measure of national power (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396673398_Ecological_Economics_in_Practice_Kawasaki's_Low-Entropy_Urban_Transition_Through_Industrial_Symbiosis_and_Thermodynamic_Governance) [13].

### II. Data as Strategic Substrate

Data serves as the raw material for cognitive power, but its strategic value is realized only through the infrastructure that moves, stores, and refines it (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1]. This infrastructure is currently characterized by an unprecedented level of concentration (https://humane-intelligence.org/post/changing-geopolitics-from-data-center-concentration/) [4].

#### Cloud Market Concentration and Data Center Geography
Data refinement occurs in massive "Hyperscale" data centers, where the cloud infrastructure market is dominated by a narrow oligopoly (https://brightlio.com/cloud-computing-statistics/) [14]. In 2024, the market was led by three American firms: **Amazon (37.7%)**, **Microsoft (23.9%)**, and **Google (9.0%)**, who collectively operate two-thirds of the global market (https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-08-06-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-22-point-5-percent-in-2024) [15]. The United States alone hosts roughly 51% of the world's data centers (https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/07/ai-geopolitics-data-centres-technological-rivalry/) [16], a concentration that forces other nations to rely on U.S.-based clouds for their most critical functions. For many middle powers, this concentration results in "Digital Dependency," as they lack the domestic capacity to store and process their own national data independently (https://humane-intelligence.org/post/changing-geopolitics-from-data-center-concentration/) [4].

#### Submarine Cable Ownership: The Physical Backbone
The physical backbone of the global internet consists of submarine fiber-optic cables that carry over 99% of intercontinental data traffic (https://www.eurasiareview.com/26122025-digital-lifelines-undersea-cables-chokepoints-and-the-evolving-sea-lines-of-communication-analysis/) [17]. As of 2025, there are approximately 597 active or planned cable systems stretching 1.5 million kilometers (https://www.eurasiareview.com/26122025-digital-lifelines-undersea-cables-chokepoints-and-the-evolving-sea-lines-of-communication-analysis/) [17]. Ownership has shifted from traditional telecom consortia to American technology giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, who now operate 48% of non-U.S. data center projects by investment value and own substantial portions of the undersea network (https://humane-intelligence.org/post/changing-geopolitics-from-data-center-concentration/) [4]. Strategic maritime chokepoints elevate systemic risk; the Red Sea corridor alone handles approximately 17% of global internet traffic (https://www.csis.org/analysis/strategic-future-subsea-cables-egypt-case-study) [18], making it a critical digital "Achilles' heel" vulnerable to accidental or deliberate disruption.

#### AI Training Compute and Prediction Advantage
Data enhances predictive capacity, which translates directly into geopolitical leverage (https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/22/2205) [3]. Access to massive datasets and high-end GPU clusters allows for the superior modeling of economic, military, and social scenarios, reducing internal uncertainty for the state (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400458611_Entropy_Prediction_and_Open_Futures_Why_Intelligence_Experiences_Possibility_in_a_Determined_World) [2]. In 2025, frontier AI models were trained on between 14 and 36 trillion tokens, marking a logarithmic increase from the 300 billion tokens required in 2020 (https://arxiv.org/html/2506.01732v1) [19]. This "Data Moat" creates a structural advantage for those who can afford the billions of dollars required for training (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Artificial-Intelligence-and-the-Great-Divergence-5.pdf) [20]. When a region consumes AI produced elsewhere, it consumes not only the tool but also the worldview and cultural memory embedded in that tool's training data (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1].

---

### III. Compute as the New Arms Race

The control of AI compute—the physical hardware required for large-scale training and inference—has become the primary lever of 21st-century statecraft (https://iamvishalkhare.medium.com/gpu-diplomacy-how-export-controls-on-gpus-are-rewriting-global-alliances-e598c30208fc) [11]. Compute asymmetry now functions as strategic asymmetry.

#### Semiconductor Fabrication Concentration
At the core of the AI revolution is an advanced semiconductor supply chain that is almost entirely dependent on **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)**. As of Q3 2025, TSMC produced approximately 90% of the world's most advanced chips (https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/predictstreet-2025-12-10-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-tsm-a-deep-dive-into-the-silicon-shield) [21]. The company's "advanced technologies" (7nm and below) accounted for 74% of its revenue, highlighting a global total dependency on these specific process nodes (https://carboncredits.com/tsmc-posts-record-q3-2025-earnings-as-ai-chip-demand-soars-39-and-sustainability-strengthens/) [22]. TSMC's strategic importance is formalized in its 2025 capital expenditure of $40-$42 billion, 70% of which is dedicated to the advanced process technologies and packaging essential for AI accelerators (https://carboncredits.com/tsmc-posts-record-q3-2025-earnings-as-ai-chip-demand-soars-39-and-sustainability-strengthens/) [22]. This concentration creates a "Silicon Shield" for Taiwan but also represents a catastrophic single point of failure for the global digital economy (https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/predictstreet-2025-12-10-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-tsm-a-deep-dive-into-the-silicon-shield) [21].

#### GPU and AI Chip Distribution
The actualization of compute power occurs in GPU clusters. By May 2025, the **United States hosted 74.5% of global AI supercomputer performance** (https://epoch.ai/data-insights/ai-supercomputers-performance-share-by-country) [23], while China held 15% (https://epoch.ai/data-insights/ai-supercomputers-performance-share-by-country) [23]. Traditional technology leaders like Germany, Japan, and France have been relegated to marginal roles, with the entire EU bloc holding only 4.8% (https://epoch.ai/data-insights/ai-supercomputers-performance-share-by-country) [23]. This concentration reflects the dominance of U.S.-based technology companies and their unprecedented investment in "gigafactories" of chips (https://www.voronoiapp.com/technology/Who-Holds-the-Worlds-AI-Compute-in-2025-US-Dominates-Others-Catch-Up-6648) [24]. High-performance AI chips, such as the NVIDIA H100, are now the "power currency" of the world, and Washington uses export controls to decide who gets to train frontier models and who is "stuck on the sidelines" (https://iamvishalkhare.medium.com/gpu-diplomacy-how-export-controls-on-gpus-are-rewriting-global-alliances-e598c30208fc) [11].

#### Export Controls and Strategic Restrictions
AI geopolitics now reaches deep into the semiconductor supply chain. Beginning in 2022, the U.S. implemented sweeping export controls to starve rival nations of the high-end GPUs critical for cutting-edge AI (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20115) [25]. These restrictions have repeatedly forced chipmakers to ship "China-only" variants with reduced performance or pause shipments entirely, reshaping national AI strategies overnight (https://iamvishalkhare.medium.com/gpu-diplomacy-how-export-controls-on-gpus-are-rewriting-global-alliances-e598c30208fc) [11]. By mid-2025, the U.S. effectively closed the last major chokepoint for top-tier hardware, signaling an intent to maintain a hardware advantage at all costs (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20115) [25]. These controls effectively impose a "ceiling" on the research potential of adversaries and allies alike.

### IV. Narrative Infrastructure & Algorithmic Power

Dominance in the 21st century extends to the "Cognitive Domain"—the processes of human reasoning, belief, and emotion (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1751406/full) [26]. Control over perception architecture is geopolitical power (https://journals.prz.edu.pl/hss/article/download/2142/1562/) [27].

#### Platform Ownership and Attention Share
Algorithmic revolutions have coincided with the unprecedented concentration of media ownership in the digital realm (https://iicintermedia.org/vol-53-issue-4/the-algorithms-grip-how-digital-gatekeepers-are-reshaping-media-pluralism/) [28]. Five major platforms—**Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft**—now control the vast majority of digital information distribution (https://iicintermedia.org/vol-53-issue-4/the-algorithms-grip-how-digital-gatekeepers-are-reshaping-media-pluralism/) [28]. Google processes over 8.5 billion searches daily (https://iicintermedia.org/vol-53-issue-4/the-algorithms-grip-how-digital-gatekeepers-are-reshaping-media-pluralism/) [28], creating a potent risk of media capture and manipulation (https://iicintermedia.org/vol-53-issue-4/the-algorithms-grip-how-digital-gatekeepers-are-reshaping-media-pluralism/) [28].

#### Algorithmic Amplification and Polarization
Algorithmic ranking systems, optimized for engagement, disproportionately surface emotionally intense and polarizing content (https://www.techpolicy.press/algorithms-shift-polarization-why-does-policy-still-miss-the-real-problem/) [29]. Independent research published in *Science* in 2025 provides causal evidence that algorithmic ranking decisions directly alter the level of political polarization among users (https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/11/27/social-media-political-polarization-research/) [30]. Increasing a user's exposure to partisan animosity was found to decrease "warmth" toward opposing parties at a rate comparable to three years of natural societal change occurring in just one week (https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/11/27/social-media-political-polarization-research/) [30]. This allows dominant platforms to engineer either the social cohesion or the fragmentation of rivals (https://sciencemediacentre.es/en/independent-research-shows-xs-twitters-algorithm-can-influence-political-polarisation) [31].

#### Cognitive Warfare and Institutional Trust
Adversaries like Russia and China are at the forefront of **Cognitive Warfare**, targeting human belief systems and social trust (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1751406/full) [26]. Russia remains the leading source of "Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior" (CIB) disrupted by major platforms, having consolidated its operations around undermining international support for Ukraine (https://www.scribd.com/document/759365273/Meta-Quarterly-Adversarial-Threat-Report-Q2-2024) [32]. The goal of such operations is not military destruction, but the erosion of institutional legitimacy and the paralysis of decision-making (https://www.acigjournal.com/Cognitive-Warfare-Disinformation-and-Corporate-Influence-in-Europe-s-Energy-nTransition,214045,0,2.html) [33]. This transformation of culture from "soft power" to "hard defense" necessitates "Cognitive Resilience," or the capacity of a society to maintain autonomy in its interpretation of reality (https://journals.prz.edu.pl/hss/article/download/2142/1562/) [27].

---

### V. Cognitive Sovereignty

Nations are responding to these concentrations of power by seeking to assert "Digital Sovereignty" and decouple from foreign infrastructure (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389356939_Digital_Sovereignty_and_Geopolitics_in_the_Field_of_Data_Protection_A_Comparison_of_the_EU_China_and_the_USA) [34].

#### Comparative National Strategies
The global landscape is divided into distinct geopolitical models of governance (https://oxfordinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Geopolitics-of-Data-Governance_Oxford_insights_Master.pdf) [35]:
*   **United States:** Follows a "business-first" model, prioritizing the commercialization of data while increasingly utilizing "Chokepoint Statecraft" and export controls to protect national security interests (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389356939_Digital_Sovereignty_and_Geopolitics_in_the_Field_of_Data_Protection_A_Comparison_of_the_EU_China_and_the_USA) [34].
*   **European Union:** Prioritizes personal privacy and individual rights through the **GDPR** and the **AI Act**, though it is often criticized for acting primarily as a regulatory power rather than a technological one (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389356939_Digital_Sovereignty_and_Geopolitics_in_the_Field_of_Data_Protection_A_Comparison_of_the_EU_China_and_the_USA) [34].
*   **China:** Emphasizes state sovereignty and security, integrating data governance into social management and national security (https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/viewFile/10361/4636) [36]. China's **PIPL** enforces strict data localization and security audits (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389356939_Digital_Sovereignty_and_Geopolitics_in_the_Field_of_Data_Protection_A_Comparison_of_the_EU_China_and_the_USA) [34].
*   **India:** Utilizes a hybrid "Digital Public Infrastructure" (DPI) model, combining state control with individual rights protection and an aggressive push to build domestic compute capacity (34k+ GPUs) to reduce reliance on foreign clouds (https://www.chathamhouse.org/2026/02/how-middle-powers-can-weather-us-and-chinese-ai-dominance/03-strategy-meets-reality) [37].

#### Infrastructure Independence vs. Dependence
A new geopolitical stratification has emerged where only the U.S. and China enjoy "full-stack supply chain control" (https://www.chathamhouse.org/2026/02/how-middle-powers-can-weather-us-and-chinese-ai-dominance/03-strategy-meets-reality) [37]. Middle powers are structurally dependent on foreign models and foreign computing power (https://www.chathamhouse.org/2026/02/how-middle-powers-can-weather-us-and-chinese-ai-dominance/03-strategy-meets-reality) [37]. Regions like Latin America face a "semantic dependency cycle," where models trained in the Global North mediate their reality (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1]. To counter this, initiatives like "LATAM GPT" represent political declarations of the right to interpret one's own reality, signaling a shift from "Compute Colonialism" to "Cognitive Pluralism" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1].

### VI. Strategic Futures

The future of the global order will be shaped by how nations navigate these infrastructural realities (https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/07/ai-geopolitics-data-centres-technological-rivalry/) [16].

#### Scenario 1: The Digital Iron Curtain (Bipolar Fragmentation)
The world slides further into fragmentation, with a "Digital Iron Curtain" separating U.S.-led and China-led tech spheres (https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/07/ai-geopolitics-data-centres-technological-rivalry/) [16]. In this scenario, data centers, networks, and AI ecosystems are divided by incompatible standards and mutual suspicions, forcing all other nations to choose a side (https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/07/ai-geopolitics-data-centres-technological-rivalry/) [16].

#### Scenario 2: Multipolar Realignment (The Rise of Middle Powers)
Middle powers weather superpower dominance by forming coalitions, such as the "Airbus for AI" initiative (https://www.chathamhouse.org/2026/02/how-middle-powers-can-weather-us-and-chinese-ai-dominance/03-strategy-meets-reality) [37]. Energy-rich states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia convert oil income into digital strength, building massive "Compute Hubs" to challenge the existing bipolarity (https://www.chathamhouse.org/2026/02/how-middle-powers-can-weather-us-and-chinese-ai-dominance/03-strategy-meets-reality) [37].

#### Scenario 3: Corporate Supra-Sovereignty
Hyperscale technology companies become more powerful than most nation-states, moving to directly capture nuclear assets and renewable fleets to power their infrastructure (https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mills_HAMM_AI_1125_Final_01.pdf) [38]. This privatization of critical energy infrastructure effectively blurs the lines between corporate mandates and national security strategy, allowing firms to act as sovereign agents in the global order (https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/dd7c2387-2f60-4b60-8c5f-6563b6aa1e4c/EnergyandAI.pdf) [9].

#### Scenario 4: Cognitive Empires
"Cognitive Empires" emerge, built not on land but on the control of the foundational technological layers of politics and society (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1]. These empires use their compute-based dominance to enforce "Semantic Dependency" on their periphery, making sovereignty measured by the ability to produce meaning rather than the ability to defend territory (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1].

---

### Conclusion

Geopolitical power has fundamentally transitioned into a **"Meaning-First" era** (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1]. Sovereignty is now partially, and increasingly, defined by control over the cognitive infrastructure of **data and compute** (https://jurnal.untirta.ac.id/index.php/aiselt/article/download/37160/15980) [5]. The **United States is currently structurally advantaged**, hosting 74.5% of global AI supercomputer performance and a dominant share of the world's data centers (https://epoch.ai/data-insights/ai-supercomputers-performance-share-by-country) [23]. **Middle powers and the Global South remain structurally vulnerable**, facing a "semantic dependency cycle" that risks turning them into epistemic subsidiaries of the Global North (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1]. 

**Cognitive Empires are indeed emerging**; they are built on information-processing asymmetry and the control of the "electron economy" required to forge the world's intelligence (https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/reframing-energy-for-the-age-of-electricity/) [10]. In the 21st century, the hegemon is not the nation with the most territory, but the one with the highest **Entropy Reduction Capacity**—the ability to turn raw data into actionable intelligence more efficiently than its rivals (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396673398_Ecological_Economics_in_Practice_Kawasaki's_Low-Entropy_Urban_Transition_Through_Industrial_Symbiosis_and_Thermodynamic_Governance) [13]. Sovereignty is no longer just about who rules the land, but who defines the cognitive architecture through which a society understands itself (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400783759_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_matter_of_geopolitics_Is_Artificial_Intelligence_a_Matter_of_Geopolitics_A_Meaning-First_Analytical_Framework_for_LATAM's_Cognitive_Sovereignty) [1].
