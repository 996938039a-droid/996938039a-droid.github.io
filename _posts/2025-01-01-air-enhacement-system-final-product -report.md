# FINAL PRODUCT REPORT - A Biologically Mediated Indoor Air Quality Enhancement System  

## 1. Problem Context and Design Intent

Indoor air quality degradation is a slow, chronic process driven by continuous human occupancy, material off-gassing, and limited ventilation. Unlike acute outdoor pollution events, indoor environments accumulate carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and fine particulate matter over hours and days. Typical residential and office spaces routinely exceed recommended CO₂ thresholds, while low-level VOCs such as formaldehyde, toluene, and xylene persist due to furniture, adhesives, paints, and cleaning agents.

Conventional air purifiers primarily rely on mechanical filtration and adsorption. These approaches are inherently passive, consumptive, and non-transformative: pollutants are trapped but not neutralized, filters saturate, and performance decays until replacement. Moreover, such systems do not address carbon dioxide at all.

The system described in this report adopts a fundamentally different approach. It integrates physical filtration, enzymatic chemical transformation, and photosynthetic gas conversion into a single indoor appliance, while maintaining strict containment of all biological components. The objective is not rapid scrubbing or medical-grade purification, but continuous, stable air quality enhancement aligned with the slow dynamics of indoor air degradation.

## 2. Core Design Philosophy

The entire system is governed by a single non-negotiable principle:

No living biological material is ever directly exposed to indoor air or to the user.

This principle drives all architectural decisions and ensures:

elimination of bioaerosol pathways

predictable long-term behavior

graceful failure modes

favorable regulatory classification

Rather than open or aerated biological systems, the device employs sealed and immobilized biological interfaces, where air interacts with biology only through controlled boundaries: solid–gas interfaces for bacteria and gas–liquid surface interfaces for algae. Any system failure results in reduced performance, never in the emergence of new hazards.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

The product is realized as a vertical, lamp-form appliance with bottom-to-top airflow and four physically distinct but aerodynamically coupled zones:

Zone 1 – Intake and Particulate Conditioning  
Mechanical removal of dust and partial PM2.5 via washable filtration.

Zone 2 – Bio-Active VOC Oxidation Chamber  
Enzymatic mineralization of VOCs using immobilized bacteria.

Zone 3 – Algal Photobioreactor with Controlled Headspace  
Photosynthetic CO₂ uptake and O₂ release through sealed gas–liquid surface exchange.

Zone 4 – Final Particulate Polishing and Exhaust  
Guaranteed filtered exhaust under negative pressure.

This staged ordering is essential. Particulates are removed before reaching biological components, VOC oxidation precedes photosynthesis, and carbon dioxide generated upstream becomes substrate downstream, creating an internal micro-scale carbon loop.

## 4. Biological Components and Mechanisms

### 4.1 Algal System: Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus

The photosynthetic layer employs a mixed culture of Chlorella vulgaris (primary) and Scenedesmus spp. (secondary). These organisms were selected for predictability, non-toxicity, and long-term stability under sealed, low-nutrient conditions.

Chlorella is a well-characterized green microalga with high CO₂ affinity at indoor concentrations, broad tolerance to light and temperature variation, and no production of harmful secondary metabolites. Scenedesmus provides ecological redundancy, with thicker cell walls and higher resilience to CO₂ fluctuation, reducing monoculture fragility.

Photosynthesis proceeds via canonical oxygenic pathways. Light reactions split water to release molecular oxygen and generate reducing power, while the Calvin cycle fixes CO₂ into biomass. In this system, nutrient limitation and moderate light intensity deliberately constrain growth, maintaining the algae in a low-rate, maintenance metabolism rather than biomass accumulation.

Gas exchange occurs only at the liquid surface within a sealed headspace. CO₂ diffuses from headspace air into the liquid, while O₂ diffuses outward. No air is bubbled through the liquid, and no liquid ever enters the airflow.

### 4.2 Bacterial System: Pseudomonas putida and Rhodococcus

VOCs present in indoor air cannot be efficiently removed by algae. They require enzymatic oxidation pathways characteristic of heterotrophic bacteria. The system therefore incorporates a dedicated bio-oxidative stage using Pseudomonas putida as the primary organism, supported by Rhodococcus spp. for hydrophobic aromatic compounds.

These bacteria are immobilized on porous ceramic beads, forming thin internal biofilms. Immobilization converts living organisms into fixed biocatalytic surfaces, preventing aerosolization, uncontrolled growth, or user exposure.

As VOC-laden air passes through the packed bed, organic molecules dissolve into moisture films lining the bead pores and are oxidized stepwise into carbon dioxide and water. Aromatic compounds undergo ring activation and cleavage before entering central metabolism. All reactions terminate in chemically benign end products. Carbon dioxide produced here becomes input for the algal stage above.

The bacterial chamber is completely light-tight and contains no free liquid. Moisture exists only as adsorbed water within the bead matrix, ensuring enzymatic activity without condensation.

## 5. Physical Product Design and Airflow Architecture

### 5.1 Form Factor and Structural Envelope

The device is constructed as a vertical cylindrical object with a glass outer shell and an internal structural spine. Glass is used for its optical clarity, chemical inertness, and psychological signaling of containment. Opaque internal elements prevent unwanted light transmission and structurally define the zones.

The base is weighted to lower the center of gravity and damp vibrations, protecting both bacterial biofilms and algal liquid from mechanical stress.

### 5.2 Airflow and Pressure Hierarchy

Airflow is bottom-to-top under a controlled negative pressure gradient, ensuring that any leaks result in inward air ingress rather than outward emission. This principle, borrowed from biosafety cabinet design, guarantees that no unfiltered air is expelled.

Air enters at the base, passes through the bottom particulate filter, and is drawn upward through the VOC chamber and algal gas-exchange region. Final exhaust occurs only after a top-mounted particulate filter, with fans positioned downstream so that all expelled air has been filtered.

### 5.3 Algal Chamber Design with Headspace Tubes

The algal photobioreactor is a sealed glass vessel containing liquid culture and a defined headspace. Two tubes penetrate the top of the chamber: one for headspace air inlet and one for outlet. Each tube is terminated with a hydrophobic, gas-permeable barrier that allows gases to pass but blocks liquid water and aerosols.

Air introduced into the headspace contacts only the liquid surface. CO₂ dissolves into the liquid; O₂ diffuses out. No bubbling, splashing, or mist generation occurs. This headspace-only design enables controlled gas exchange while preserving full liquid containment.

### 5.4 Optical and Thermal Management

LED lighting is arranged annularly around the algal chamber, tuned to photosynthetically active wavelengths. Light intensity is moderate and continuous to avoid photoinhibition and thermal cycling. All other zones are optically isolated to prevent biological destabilization and visual leakage.

Heat generated by lighting is dissipated through the glass envelope and upward airflow, maintaining stable internal temperatures.

## 6. Maintenance and Lifecycle Behavior

User maintenance is intentionally limited to airflow hygiene. Monthly tasks include rinsing the bottom particulate filter and, if required, cleaning the top polishing filter. No user interaction with biological components is ever required.

The bacterial VOC cartridge is replaced annually as a sealed unit. Once removed, it dries out and becomes biologically inert, allowing disposal without special handling.

The algal chamber is not a consumable. It is designed to persist for the expected product lifetime, with gradual performance tapering rather than abrupt failure. Even if algal activity declines, the device continues to function as a PM and VOC purifier.

## 7. Failure Modes and Safety Behavior

The system is explicitly designed so that no failure mode produces harm.

Reduced airflow slows biological activity naturally.

Loss of light halts photosynthesis without generating by-products.

VOC cartridge exhaustion results in reduced VOC oxidation, not emission.

No condition produces aerosols, liquid leaks into airflow, or secondary pollutants.

All failures degrade performance rather than safety.

## 8. Regulatory Risk Analysis

From a regulatory standpoint, the principal concerns for biological air treatment devices are exposure pathways, bioaerosols, secondary emissions, and user handling of living material.

This system neutralizes those risks architecturally:

All biology is sealed or immobilized.

No open liquid or free microbes exist.

Exhaust air is always filtered.

End products are limited to CO₂, H₂O, and O₂.

Users never interact with biological components.

As a result, the device can be positioned as a decorative indoor air quality enhancement appliance, rather than a medical device or biological reactor, substantially reducing regulatory burden.

## 9. Final System Characterization

This product is not an experimental bioreactor disguised as a lamp. It is a biologically constrained appliance, in which living systems are deliberately slowed, contained, and stabilized to align with domestic environments.

Particles are physically removed.  
Chemical vapors are enzymatically mineralized.  
Carbon dioxide is biologically fixed.  
Oxygen is passively returned.

All transformations occur behind sealed interfaces, and all biological systems fail safely.


## Instrumentation and Control Architecture - An Embedded Sensing Extension of the Core Product Design

## 10. Purpose of Instrumentation Within the Product Architecture

The instrumentation layer in this system is not intended to transform the device into an actively optimized bioreactor. Instead, its role is to observe, interpret, and constrain the behavior of physical and biological processes that are already defined by the product’s structural design. The system’s biological components—immobilized bacteria and sealed algal cultures—operate on slow, self-regulating time scales. Instrumentation therefore exists not to accelerate or intensify these processes, but to ensure that they remain within validated operating envelopes over the lifetime of the product.

Accordingly, sensors are selected and positioned based on three criteria: (i) whether the measured variable has a clear physical meaning within a given zone, (ii) whether that variable can drift in ways that threaten stability or safety, and (iii) whether the system possesses a legitimate actuator capable of influencing that variable without introducing new risks. Any sensor that does not meet all three criteria is excluded, regardless of theoretical interest.

## 11. Zone-Based Instrumentation Framework

Instrumentation follows the same vertical zoning logic as the product itself. Each zone represents a distinct physical regime, and sensors are interpreted only within the context of that regime. Signals are never acted upon globally without cross-validation from adjacent zones, preserving causal clarity.

## 12. Zone 1: Intake and Pre-Filtration Instrumentation

Zone 1 represents the boundary between the indoor environment and the internal system. Sensors here are tasked with characterizing air loading and mechanical resistance, not biological activity.

The differential pressure sensor spanning the bottom particulate filter measures the resistance imposed by accumulated particulate matter. This signal has a direct mechanical interpretation: increasing pressure drop corresponds to increasing obstruction. The system does not attempt to compensate aggressively for this condition. Instead, the signal is translated into a state classification—normal, degraded, or intervention-required—because excessive airflow compensation would compromise downstream biological stability and acoustic comfort.

Airflow measurement downstream of the intake fan provides confirmation that the mass transport assumptions underlying the VOC and algal stages remain valid. Deviations between expected airflow, fan power, and pressure differential are interpreted diagnostically rather than reactively, allowing the system to detect seal failures, fan wear, or filter misplacement without resorting to unsafe overrides.

Temperature and humidity sensing in this zone provide contextual environmental data. These signals are not controlled directly, but they inform protective moderation strategies, such as limiting airflow during extreme dryness to preserve bacterial moisture or increasing airflow under high humidity to avoid condensation.

## 13. Zone 2: Bio-Active VOC Oxidation Instrumentation

The VOC oxidation chamber is chemically active but biologically constrained. Instrumentation here exists to prevent mechanical or environmental stress from destabilizing enzymatic activity.

Differential pressure across the immobilized bacterial cartridge is the primary signal of cartridge health. Gradual increases reflect expected biofilm maturation and particulate accumulation; abrupt increases indicate abnormal fouling. Importantly, the system interprets this signal as a limit, not as a performance deficit. When thresholds are approached, airflow is reduced rather than increased, prioritizing biological integrity over VOC throughput.

Humidity sensing immediately downstream of the cartridge provides insight into the water activity within the bead matrix. Because the bacteria rely on adsorbed moisture rather than free liquid, this signal serves as a proxy for enzymatic viability. Control responses are indirect and slow, adjusting airflow to rebalance evaporation rates rather than introducing active humidification.

If included, a VOC proxy sensor downstream of the chamber serves as a trend indicator only. Its readings are used to estimate cartridge lifecycle and to detect environmental overload events. Under no circumstances does this signal override pressure or humidity constraints, reflecting the system’s bias toward safety over apparent performance.

## 14. Zone 3: Algal Photobioreactor Instrumentation

Zone 3 is the biological core of the system and therefore the most carefully instrumented, yet also the most conservatively controlled.

The pH sensor embedded in the algal liquid provides the most direct proxy for photosynthetic activity. Changes in pH reflect the balance between carbon dioxide dissolution and biological uptake. Rising pH trends indicate CO₂ limitation relative to photosynthetic demand, while falling trends indicate CO₂ surplus or reduced metabolic activity. The system responds to these trends by modulating headspace air exchange and, secondarily, light intensity. Importantly, pH is never driven toward a fixed setpoint; it is maintained within a broad, biologically stable corridor.

Temperature sensing within the algal liquid protects against chronic thermal stress. Elevated temperatures prompt light attenuation or enhanced convective cooling via airflow adjustments, while lower temperatures are tolerated without corrective action, reflecting the asymmetric risks associated with thermal deviation.

Airflow sensing within the algal headspace inlet quantifies the rate of gas exchange at the liquid surface. This signal represents the system’s most direct biological control lever, governing CO₂ availability and oxygen removal. Adjustments are deliberately incremental, ensuring that biological response times are respected and that oscillatory behavior is avoided.

Differential pressure sensing across the headspace tubing and hydrophobic gas barriers serves a containment validation role. Any abnormal increase in resistance is treated as a safety event, immediately restricting headspace airflow to prevent liquid displacement or barrier failure. Performance considerations are subordinated to containment integrity.

Optional optical density sensing across the algal chamber provides long-term insight into biomass trends. This signal operates on timescales of weeks to months and informs lifecycle management rather than real-time control.

## 15. Zone 4: Exhaust Validation Instrumentation

Zone 4 instrumentation exists to validate net system behavior, not to drive upstream processes directly.

Differential pressure across the final particulate filter confirms that all exhaust air remains filtered and that no bypass paths have developed. Control responses mirror those at the intake stage, favoring maintenance signaling over aggressive airflow compensation.

The exhaust CO₂ sensor provides the system’s most integrative chemical signal. When interpreted alongside intake CO₂, algal pH trends, and airflow data, it confirms whether biological carbon fixation is occurring at the expected rate. Control responses propagate upstream in a defined order: first adjusting algal headspace exchange, then light intensity, and only finally overall airflow. This ordering ensures that biological mechanisms are exercised before mechanical ones.

Fan speed and power monitoring across intake and exhaust assemblies provide mechanical validation. Discrepancies between commanded and observed behavior trigger graceful derating or fault isolation, never unsafe compensation.

## 16. Translation of Sensor Data into Control Authority

Across all zones, sensor readings are translated into constraints, permissions, and trends, not instantaneous commands. The system deliberately avoids tight feedback loops that would attempt to force biological processes into rapid response. Instead, it relies on bounded, monotonic adjustments that allow biology to equilibrate naturally.

The only actuators exercised by the system are airflow (via fans), gas access to the algal headspace, and light intensity. Each actuator is constrained by multiple independent sensors, ensuring that no single signal can drive the system into an unsafe or unstable state.

## 17. Instrumentation as a Regulatory and Safety Asset

From a regulatory perspective, the instrumentation layer strengthens rather than complicates the product’s safety posture. Sensors provide continuous verification that containment assumptions remain valid, that biological components are not overstressed, and that exhaust air remains filtered. Importantly, none of the sensors introduce new exposure pathways or require user interaction with biological materials.

The system therefore remains classifiable as a consumer air quality appliance with embedded monitoring, rather than as an actively manipulated biological device.

## 18. Closing Statement of the Instrumentation Extension

This instrumentation architecture does not seek to dominate or optimize the biological system. It exists to render the system legible, ensuring that slow, stable biological processes remain aligned with mechanical and environmental realities over the lifetime of the product.

In doing so, the IoT layer becomes an extension of the product’s original design philosophy: containment over exposure, stability over intensity, and interpretation over intervention.
